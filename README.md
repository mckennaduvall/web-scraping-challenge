# Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars

Built a web application that scapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays information to single HTML page. Used Jupyter notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter for initial web scraping.


### NASA Mars News

Scraped the [Mars News Site](https://redplanetscience.com/) and collected the latest News Title and Paragraph Text to be used for my dashboard.

### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image

Visited the url for the Featured Space Image site [here](https://spaceimages-mars.com) and used splinter to navigate the site and find image url for my dashboard.


### Mars Facts

Visit the Mars Facts webpage [here](https://galaxyfacts-mars.com) and used Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc.


### Mars Hemispheres

Visited the astrogeology site [here](https://marshemispheres.com/) to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.



## MongoDB and Flask Application

Used MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.
